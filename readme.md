tenantdb:fresh      Drop all tables and re-run all migrations
tenantdb:install    Create the migration repository
tenantdb:make       Create a new migration file
tenantdb:refresh    Reset and re-run all migrations
tenantdb:reset      Rollback all database migrations
tenantdb:rollback   Rollback the last database migration
tenantdb:status     Show the status of each migration
```

#### Creating Migrations

In order to generate an empty migration, run the following command example.

`php artisan tenantdb:make create_orders_table --create=orders`

This will create a migration class into the right directory.

To declare your table fields, just follow the usual schema build practices, this package don't make anything different there.

#### Running Migrations

In order to run an migration to all tenants, run the following command example.

`php artisan tenantdb:migrate --all`

`php artisan tenantdb:rollback --all`

In order to run an migration to single tenant, run the following command example.

`php artisan tenantdb:migrate --tenant=1001`

`php artisan tenantdb:rollback --tenant=1001`
